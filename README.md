# Human-Action-Recognition
This project is for Computer Vision course - Innopolis University - S23

This project uses Detectron2 and LSTM to recognize human actions in videos. 
Detectron2: a powerful object detection library that is capable of detecting humans in video frames. [a link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)
LSTM: a type of recurrent neural network that is capable of processing sequences of inputs such as time-series data.
Dataset: RNN for Human Activity Recognition - 2D Pose Input [a link](https://github.com/stuarteiffert/RNN-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-using-2D-Pose-Input#dataset-overview)

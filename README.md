# Human-Action-Recognition
This project is for Computer Vision course - Innopolis University - S23

This project uses Detectron2 and LSTM to recognize human actions in videos. 
## Detectron2 is a powerful object detection library that is capable of detecting humans in video frames. 
## LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that is capable of processing sequences of inputs such as time-series data.
